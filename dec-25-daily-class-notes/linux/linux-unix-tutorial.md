# linux unix tutorial

**Linux** is one of the most widely used open-source operating systems. It's fast, secure, stable, and powers everything from smartphones and servers to cloud platforms and IoT devices. Linux is especially popular among developers, system administrators, and DevOps professionals.

**Linux is:**

* A Unix-like OS used in servers, cloud infrastructure, supercomputers, personal computers and embedded systems.
* Reliable and secure, making it ideal for web hosting, networking, and automation.
* Preferred in DevOps, where it's used for scripting, configuration, containerization (Docker), and CI/CD pipelines.
* Open-source and customizable, giving users full control over their systems and workflows.

This Linux tutorial is designed for both beginners and experienced professionals. It covers everything from basic commands and file management to advanced topics like file permissions and shell scripting.

### 1. Understanding Linux Basics

In this section, we cover the basics of the Linux operating system, how it works, and how it's different from Unix. Learn about the concept of Linux distributions (distros), why they exist, and how to choose the right one based on your needs—whether you're a beginner, developer, or system admin.

* Introduction to Linux Operating System
* What are Linux Distributions?
* Choosing a Linux Distribution
* Difference between Linux/Unix

#### Installing Linux

Before getting started with Linux, we need to set it up on your system. Common methods:

### 2. Linux Commands

Linux commands are instructions entered in the terminal to perform tasks such as navigating directories, managing files, monitoring system performance, and installing software. Learn the most commonly used commands and a complete list for deeper study.

### 3. Linux File System

The Linux file system organizes data in a hierarchical structure, starting from the root ("/"). It defines how files and directories are stored, accessed, and managed, ensuring efficient system navigation and resource organization. Explore key components including the directory structure, file types, absolute and relative paths, and mount points.
