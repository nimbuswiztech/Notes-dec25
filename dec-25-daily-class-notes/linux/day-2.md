### Vi/Vim Editor Commands

#### 16. `:/pattern`

**Purpose**: Search for a pattern in the current file within Vim editor. **Usage**: `/pattern` searches forward from the current cursor position for the first occurrence of "pattern". **Example**: `:/devops` will find the first occurrence of "devops" in the file. **Navigation**:

* Press `n` to go to the next occurrence
* Press `N` to go to the previous occurrence

#### 17. `:%s/Testing/development/g`

**Purpose**: Replace all occurrences of "Testing" with "development" across the entire file. **Breakdown**:

* `%` = Apply to all lines in the file
* `s` = Substitute command
* `/Testing/` = Find pattern
* `/development/` = Replace pattern
* `g` = Global flag (replace all occurrences on each line) **Example**: If file has "Testing is important. Testing is critical." it becomes "development is important. development is critical."

#### 18. `:1 s/Testing/dev/g`

**Purpose**: Replace all occurrences of "Testing" with "dev" on line 1 only. **Breakdown**:

* `:1` = Target line 1
* `s/Testing/dev/` = Substitute command
* `g` = Replace all occurrences on that line **Example**: On line 1, "Testing Testing code" becomes "dev dev code"

#### 19. `:5,$ s/Testing/dev/g`

**Purpose**: Replace all occurrences of "Testing" with "dev" from line 5 to the end of the file. **Breakdown**:

* `:5,$` = Line 5 to end of file ($ represents last line)
* `s/Testing/dev/` = Substitute command
* `g` = Replace all occurrences on each line in the range **Example**: All lines from 5 onwards have "Testing" replaced with "dev"

#### 20. `1,5 s/Testing/dev/g`

**Purpose**: Replace all occurrences of "Testing" with "dev" from line 1 to line 5. **Breakdown**:

* `1,5` = Lines 1 through 5
* `s/Testing/dev/` = Substitute command
* `g` = Replace all occurrences on each line **Example**: Only the first 5 lines are affected by the replacement

***

### Directory and File Creation

#### 21. `mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3/Users/apple/Documents/Devops/Ref class Notes/linux Devops-class-13-May-2022.txt`

**Purpose**: Create a nested directory structure, creating parent directories as needed. Note: The `.txt` file is actually part of the directory path (not a file). **Breakdown**:

* `mkdir` = Make directory command
* `-p` = Parent flag (creates all intermediate directories if they don't exist)
* Path creates: `dir1/dir2/dir3/Users/apple/Documents/Devops/Ref class Notes/linux Devops-class-13-May-2022.txt` as a directory **Important**: Without `-p`, this command would fail if parent directories don't exist. With `-p`, all missing parent directories are automatically created. **Example**: Creates the entire hierarchy in one command instead of creating each level separately.

***

### Word Count Command (wc)

#### 22. `wc filename`

**Purpose**: Display the number of lines, words, and bytes in a file. **Output Format**: `[lines] [words] [bytes] filename` **Example Output**: `10 50 250 filename`

#### 23. `wc -l f1`

**Purpose**: Count and display only the number of lines in file f1. **Breakdown**: `-l` = Lines only flag **Example Output**: `42 f1` (means the file has 42 lines)

#### 24. `wc -w f1`

**Purpose**: Count and display only the number of words in file f1. **Breakdown**: `-w` = Words only flag **Example Output**: `156 f1` (means the file has 156 words)

#### 25. `wc -c f1`

**Purpose**: Count and display only the number of bytes in file f1. **Breakdown**: `-c` = Bytes only flag **Example Output**: `1024 f1` (means the file is 1024 bytes)

#### 26. `wc -m f1`

**Purpose**: Count and display only the number of characters in file f1. **Breakdown**: `-m` = Characters only flag **Note**: Unlike `-c` (bytes), `-m` counts actual characters (important for multi-byte UTF-8 characters) **Example Output**: `950 f1` (means the file has 950 characters)

***

### Echo Command

#### 27. `echo "statement"`

**Purpose**: Print the text "statement" to standard output (terminal). **Output**: `statement` **Usage**: Commonly used to display messages, variables, or create file content in scripts.

#### 28. `echo -e "Hi \nThis is devops class \nThird line"`

**Purpose**: Print text with escape sequences interpreted (newlines will be actual line breaks). **Breakdown**:

* `-e` = Enable interpretation of backslash escapes
* `\n` = Newline character **Output**:

```
Hi
This is devops class
Third line
```

**Without `-e`**: Would print literally as `Hi \nThis is devops class \nThird line`

***

### Input/Output Redirection

#### 29. `> [Redirect]`

**Purpose**: Redirect standard output to a file, overwriting the file if it exists. **Example**: `echo "Hello" > output.txt` creates output.txt with content "Hello" **Important**: Overwrites existing file content without warning. **Usage**: `command > filename`

#### 30. `>> [Append]`

**Purpose**: Redirect standard output to a file, appending to existing content (does not overwrite). **Example**: `echo "New line" >> output.txt` adds "New line" to the end of output.txt **Important**: Preserves existing file content and adds new content at the end. **Usage**: `command >> filename`

***

### Disk Usage Command (du)

#### 31. `du filename`

**Purpose**: Display disk usage of a specific file in disk blocks (usually 512 bytes per block). **Output Example**: `8 filename` (means 8 blocks, approximately 4KB) **Note**: For files, du shows allocated disk space, not logical file size.

#### 32. `du -sh filename`

**Purpose**: Display human-readable disk usage of a file in a simplified format. **Breakdown**:

* `-s` = Summary (total size only, not details)
* `-h` = Human-readable (shows K, M, G, T for kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes) **Output Example**: `2.5M filename`

#### 33. `du -sh directory_name`

**Purpose**: Display total human-readable disk usage of a directory and all its contents. **Breakdown**:

#### 45. `grep -i "devops" f1`

**Purpose**: Search for "devops" in file f1, case-insensitive. **Breakdown**: `-i` = Ignore case (matches "devops", "DEVOPS", "DevOps", etc.) **Output**: All lines containing "devops" regardless of case **Example**: Finds "DEVOPS Engineer" and "devops class" with same command

#### 46. `grep -in "pattern" filename`

**Purpose**: Search for "pattern" in filename, case-insensitive, and show line numbers. **Breakdown**:

* `-i` = Ignore case
* `-n` = Print line numbers **Output Format**: `[line_number]:[matching_line]` **Example Output**: `5:This is a pattern line` (pattern found on line 5)
