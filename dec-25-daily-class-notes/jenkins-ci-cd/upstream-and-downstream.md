# upstream and downstream

### What is Upstream and Downstream in Jenkins?

In Jenkins, **Upstream** and **Downstream** jobs define the build dependency flow between Jenkins jobs (projects/pipelines):

```
job-A  -->  Job-B
 ↑          ↓
Upstream   Downstream
```

### Definitions

* Upstream Job: A job that **triggers another job** after it completes.
* Downstream Job: A job that is **triggered** after another job finishes.

***

### Example Scenario (Real-Time)

Let’s say you have a DevOps pipeline:

* Job-A: Checkout code from GitHub
* Job-B: Build the application
* Job-C: Deploy to development environment
* Job-D: Run automated tests

Here:

* Job-A is upstream to Job-B
* Job-B is downstream of Job-A
* Job-B is upstream to Job-C
* Job-D is downstream of Job-C

***

### Real-World Analogy

Think of a conveyor belt in a factory.

* Upstream: The machines earlier in the line (e.g., raw material prep)
* Downstream: The machines later in the line (e.g., packaging)

If something breaks upstream, downstream cannot proceed.

### How to Set Up Upstream/Downstream in Jenkins

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Using Freestyle Projects (Post-Build Actions)

* Go to **Job-A → Configure**
* Scroll to **Post-build Actions**
* Click **“Add post-build action” → “Build other projects”**
* Enter: `Job-B`
* Save

Now whenever Job-A runs successfully, it will trigger Job-B (downstream).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Using Build Triggers

* Go to **Job-B → Configure**
* Scroll to **Build Triggers**
* Check **Build after other projects are built**
* Enter: `Job-A`
* Save

This means Job-B will be triggered after Job-A (its upstream) completes.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Pipeline Jobs

Example (Declarative Pipeline):

{% code title="Jenkinsfile" %}
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Building..."
            }
        }
        stage('Trigger Downstream') {
            steps {
                build job: 'Job-B'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### View Upstream/Downstream Links in Jenkins

Jenkins automatically shows these links on the job dashboard:

* “Upstream Projects”: Shows which jobs trigger this one
* “Downstream Projects”: Shows which jobs are triggered after this

Useful for visualizing job chains.

***

### Real-Time Use Cases

* Microservices Deployment
  * Job-A: Build Docker image for Service-A
  * Job-B: Push image to ECR (downstream)
  * Job-C: Deploy to Kubernetes (downstream of B)
* Test Automation Pipeline
  * Job-A: Build app
  * Job-B: Run unit tests
  * Job-C: Run integration tests (triggered only after unit tests succeed)

***

### Teaching Tips

* Show students how to create 2 simple jobs: Job-A and Job-B
* Add `echo` or print statements to distinguish jobs
* Use post-build trigger to link Job-A → Job-B
* Let them run Job-A and observe how Job-B starts automatically

***

### Trigger Conditions for Downstream Jobs

When configuring: Job-A → Post-build Actions → Build other projects, you can choose when Jenkins triggers the downstream job. Use the stepper below to inspect each option.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Trigger only if build is stable

Meaning: Downstream job will run only if the upstream job finished successfully (exit status 0).

Use Case: In a CI/CD pipeline where Job-A builds the code and Job-B runs automated tests — you don't want to run tests unless the build is successful.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Trigger even if the build is unstable

Meaning: Triggers downstream even if the upstream job is unstable (e.g., test failures or warnings), but not if it fails.

Jenkins marks a build unstable when there are warnings or some failed tests while the build still completes.

Use Case: Run test reports or send notifications even if some tests fail; maybe deploy to dev on minor issues.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Trigger even if the build fails

Meaning: Downstream job will run even if upstream job fails completely (non-zero exit).

Use Case: Send failure reports, clean up environment, or rollback previous deployment.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Always trigger, even if the build is aborted

Meaning: No matter what happens in Job-A (success, unstable, failure, or manually aborted), Jenkins will trigger Job-B.

Use Case: Always run cleanup jobs or always send audit logs / Slack notifications.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
