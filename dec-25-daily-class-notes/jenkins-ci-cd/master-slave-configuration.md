Once you save the above configuration you will get a command which should be executed on the agent. It contains agent.jar, a secret-file, and a jnlp file.

{% code title="start-agent.sh" %}
```bash
echo "secret_key" > secret-file
java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://<Jenkins_URL>/computer/abc/jenkins-agent.jnlp -secret @secret-file -workDir "/home/ec2-user"
```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Use the agent in a job

Once connected you can create or edit a job to choose this option in the "Restrict where this project can be run" setting.
