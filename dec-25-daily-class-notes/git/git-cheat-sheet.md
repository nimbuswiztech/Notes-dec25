In this **Git Cheat Sheet,** we’ve covered all the basics to advanced Git commands that the developers required during the development and deployment process. Moreover, it is well-structured and categorized according to different use cases. It includes Git and GitHub, Git download, Git Configuration & Setup, Git commands, Git bash, Creating and Getting Git Projects, Git Snapshots, Branching and Merging in Git, Sharing and Updating in Git, Git Comparison, Managing History in Git, and more.

### What is Git?

Git is the free and open-source distributed [version control systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/version-control-systems/) that's responsible for everything **GitHub** related that happens locally on your computer.

### Understanding Version Control

Version control, also known as source control, is the technique of tracking and managing changes to codes and these are the systems that are software tools that enable software teams to manage modifications to source code as time passes.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a widely-used Free-to-use cloud Storage platform with version control and many other essential features that specifically helps developers to manage and deploy their projects on GitHub.

### Benefits of Using Git

* **History Tracking**: Git allows you to track every change made in your project, including: who made the change and when it was made.
* **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can be able work on the same project at the same time, and Git efficiently manages the merging of changes in code.
* **Branching and Merging**: Git enables developers to create branches to work on new features or bug fixes and later merge them back into the main codebase.
* **Offline Work**: Git works offline, which means you can commit changes and work on your project even without an internet connection.
